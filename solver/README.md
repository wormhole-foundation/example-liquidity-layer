## Testnet Example Solver

The example solver is split up into three processes: `vaaAuctionRelayer`, `improveOffer` and
`executeOrder`. All three rely on the same configuration file, which can created by copying the
sample file `cfg/testnet/sample.config.json`.

To get started, create a durable nonce account (see these
[instructions](https://solana.com/developers/guides/advanced/introduction-to-durable-nonces)) with
your Solana keypair. Copy the public key and move it to the `nonceAccount` field in your config.

**NOTE: We encourage using a durable nonce to avoid an expired blockhash error in case there is
network congestion. We demonstrate how to use this nonce account in the `vaaAuctionRelayer`
process.**

Next, you'll need an RPC for each network that you wish to relay `FastMarketOrders` from. Add each
RPC to the config for the corresponding chain name.

Finally, you will need a funded USDC Associated Token Account (ATA), whose owner is your keypair.
Ensure that your private key is securely stored in the `.env` file under the `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`
variable. This key is essential for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain.
Format the private key as a base64 string before adding it to the `.env` file.

### Vaa Auction Relayer

The `vaaAuctionRelayer` listens for `FastMarketOrder` VAAs emitted by the Liquidity Layer's network
of contracts. It determines if the `maxFee` encoded in the `FastMarketOrder` VAA is high enough to
participate in an auction, if it is, it executes a `place_initial_offer` instruction on the Solana
`MatchingEngine`.

If any known token accounts are the highest bidder at the end of an auction, this process will settle
the auction by executing the `settle_auction_complete` instruction and posting the finalized VAA
associated with the auction's `FastMarketOrder` VAA. For the `vaaAuctionRelayer`Â to recognize executed
fast transfers and execute the `settle_auction_complete` instruction, add the owner's public key to the
`knownAtaOwners` array field in the configuration file.

The `vaaAuctionRelayer` relies on the [Beacon](https://github.com/pyth-network/beacon) as the `VaaSpy` to listen for `FastMarketOrder` VAAs. To set up the
Beacon, increase the UDP buffer size for the OS:

```sh
# for linux
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2097152
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2097152
# for macos
sudo sysctl -w net.inet.udp.recvspace=2097152
```

Then, make sure Docker is running and execute the following command to run Beacon in a detached mode:

```sh
make wormhole-spy-up NETWORK=testnet
```

To stop or restart the beacon

```sh
make wormhole-spy-down
make wormhole-spy-restart NETWORK=testnet
```

`vaaAuctionRelayer` depends on the `@wormhole-foundation/example-liquidity-layer-solana` Typescript SDK. To make sure we can use this SDK, in the root directory of the repository:

```sh
npm ci && npm run build
```

To run the `vaaAuctionRelayer` execute the following command:

```sh
npm run relayer -- path/to/config/your.config.json
```

### Improve Offers

The `improveOffer` process listens for `AuctionUpdated` events on the `MatchingEngine` via
websocket. Once an auction has been initiated, this process will determine if it is willing to
improve the offer based on the `pricing` parameters in your config.

To run the `improveOffer` script, execute the following command:

```sh
npm run improve -- path/to/config/your.config.json
```

### Execute Fast Orders

The `executeOrder` process listens for `AuctionUpdated` events on the `MatchingEngine` via
websocket. At the end of an auction's duration (see `endSlot` of the `AuctionUpdated` event), this
process will execute the order reflecting this auction within the auction's grace period.

**NOTE: You will need an address lookup table for the execute order instructions because these
instructions require so many accounts. This LUT address can be added to your config.**

To run the `executeOrder` script, execute the following command:

```sh
npm run execute -- path/to/config/your.config.json
```
